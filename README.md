# Gango: A Go-Based Backend Service Framework

Gango is an open-source project written in Go that provides a robust and flexible foundation for developing backend
services. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, Gango simplifies the process of creating backend
systems by automating many of the essential tasks.

## Features

- **Service Generation**: With Gango, you can easily generate a new backend service project. This includes creating a
  new directory with all the basic components you need for your backend system.

- **Docker Integration**: Gango streamlines the process of containerizing your service. A Dockerfile is provided, and
  you can build a Docker image with a simple command.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Installation

1. Clone the Gango repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sepehrsoh/gango.git
   cd gango
   ```

2. Run the following command to set up your Gango environment:

   ```bash
   make all
   ```

3. Create a new project using Gango:

   ```bash
   ./gango generate -n project-name -p redis -p elastic -p postgres
   ```
    * **_Note: supported providers listed below:_**
   
        * `redis`

        * `elastic`

        * `postgres`

   This command will create a new directory with your chosen service name, preconfigured with the basics you need for a
   backend system.

4. If you want to dockerized your service, navigate to the new service directory:

   ```bash
   cd [service-name]
   ```

5. Build a Docker image for your service:

   ```bash
   make build-docker
   ```

## Usage

Now that you have your Gango-based backend service up and running, you can start building and customizing your project.
Here are some commands and conventions you should be aware of:

- Modify your service code, endpoints, and database configurations in the `[service-name]` directory.
- Create routes, add middleware, and define models and controllers.
- Leverage the power of Go to build your backend system according to your requirements.
