# {{.ProjectName}}

Welcome to {{.ProjectName}}! This repository is generated using Gango, a Go-based backend service framework. This README will help you get started with your new project.

## Getting Started

To create this project on your local machine, use the following command:

``` bash
make all
```

This command will set up your project environment and generate a new service unix file with the name {{.ProjectName}}.

You can run your service using the following command:

```bash
./{{.ProjectName}} serve
```

For example, we've included a sample ```Hello, World!``` API on the route `/v1/hello-world` to get you started.

## Building for Linux

To build your project for Linux, use the following command:

```bash
make linux
```

## Updating Dependencies

To update project dependencies, run:

```bash
make dependencies
```

## Dockerize Your Project

Dockerizing your project is made easy with Gango. You can create a Docker image with the following command:

```bash
make build-docker
docker run {{.ProjectName}}:latest
```

Once the image is built, you can run it using Docker.

## Project Structure

Inside the `src/service` directory, you'll find three important subdirectories:

1. **configs**: To add or modify configurations for your service, update the files in this directory.

2. **providers**: This directory is where you can add more service providers. Examples like Redis and Gin Gonic, which serve as the web server, can be found here.

3. **wiring**: In the `wire.go` file, you'll find a struct using the Singleton pattern. To add services to this wiring, you can modify the `service.go` file. Internal methods, such as metric host and port, controller registry, and other critical components, are located in `internal.go`.
